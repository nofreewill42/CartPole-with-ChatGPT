Action Space

The action is a 1D ndarray with shape (1,), representing the direction of the force applied to the cart. There are two possible values:

0   Apply force to move the cart to the left

1   Apply force to move the cart to the right

Note: The velocity change caused by the applied force is not constant, as it depends on the pole's angle. The varying center of gravity of the pole affects the amount of energy needed to move the cart underneath it.


Observation Space

The observation space in the CartPole problem consists of four elements, each representing a specific attribute of the cart and pole system. These elements are described below:

1.    Cart Position: The horizontal position of the cart, which can range from -4.8 to 4.8 units. However, the episode will terminate if the cart goes outside the range of -2.4 to 2.4 units.

2.    Cart Velocity: The horizontal speed of the cart. There is no specified minimum or maximum value for this attribute.

3.    Pole Angle: The angle of the pole with respect to the vertical position, measured in radians. The angle can range from approximately -0.418 radians (-24 degrees) to 0.418 radians (24 degrees). The episode will terminate if the pole angle goes outside the range of -0.2095 to 0.2095 radians (±12 degrees).

4.    Pole Angular Velocity: The rate at which the pole's angle changes. There is no specified minimum or maximum value for this attribute.

These four elements form a 1-dimensional array (ndarray) of shape (4,) that represents the current state of the CartPole system. It is important to note that while the observation space defines the possible values for each element, some of these values will cause the episode to end prematurely, as indicated in the notes above.


Strategy

A simple strategy to balance the pole on the cart is to apply a force in the direction of the pole's tilt. This strategy aims to counteract the pole's tilt by moving the cart underneath the pole's center of gravity. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1.    Observe the pole's angle (θ) relative to the vertical position.
2.    If the pole is tilting to the right (θ > 0), apply a force to move the cart to the right (Action: 1).
3.    If the pole is tilting to the left (θ < 0), apply a force to move the cart to the left (Action: 0).
4.    Continuously monitor the pole's angle and adjust the cart's movement accordingly.

While this strategy can help maintain balance for a short period, it may not be sufficient for long-term stability or complex scenarios. More advanced control strategies, such as PID controllers or reinforcement learning algorithms, can be used to improve the cart's performance in balancing the pole.
