Action Space

The action is a 1D ndarray with shape (1,), representing the direction of the force applied to the cart. There are two possible values:

0   Apply force to move the cart to the left

1   Apply force to move the cart to the right

Note: The velocity change caused by the applied force is not constant, as it depends on the pole's angle. The varying center of gravity of the pole affects the amount of energy needed to move the cart underneath it.


Observation Space

The observation space in the CartPole problem consists of four elements, each representing a specific attribute of the cart and pole system. These elements are described below:

1.    Cart Position: The horizontal position of the cart, which can range from -4.8 to 4.8 units. However, the episode will terminate if the cart goes outside the range of -2.4 to 2.4 units.

2.    Cart Velocity: The horizontal speed of the cart. There is no specified minimum or maximum value for this attribute.

3.    Pole Angle: The angle of the pole with respect to the vertical position, measured in radians. The angle can range from approximately -0.418 radians (-24 degrees) to 0.418 radians (24 degrees). The episode will terminate if the pole angle goes outside the range of -0.2095 to 0.2095 radians (Â±12 degrees).

4.    Pole Angular Velocity: The rate at which the pole's angle changes. There is no specified minimum or maximum value for this attribute.

These four elements form a 1-dimensional array (ndarray) of shape (4,) that represents the current state of the CartPole system. It is important to note that while the observation space defines the possible values for each element, some of these values will cause the episode to end prematurely, as indicated in the notes above.


Strategy

Here is a strategy to balance the pole in the CartPole environment:

1.    If the pole is tilting to the left (negative angle) and its angular velocity is also negative (pole falling left), push the cart to the left.
2.    If the pole is tilting to the right (positive angle) and its angular velocity is also positive (pole falling right), push the cart to the right.
3.    If the pole is tilting to the left (negative angle) but its angular velocity is positive (pole recovering from a fall to the left), push the cart to the right to counteract the motion.
4.    If the pole is tilting to the right (positive angle) but its angular velocity is negative (pole recovering from a fall to the right), push the cart to the left to counteract the motion.
5.    If the cart is moving left (negative cart velocity) and the pole is relatively straight, push the cart to the right to prevent it from hitting the edge of the environment.
6.    If the cart is moving right (positive cart velocity) and the pole is relatively straight, push the cart to the left to prevent it from hitting the edge of the environment.
7.    If none of the above conditions are met, maintain the current direction.
